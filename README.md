# ExpenseBot for Workplace

This is a lightweight example of an expense claim submission and manager approval process using a bot in Workplace.

This example shows an implementation of a state machine to track conversation states across multiple recipients, and shows how to use the generic template as a view into the state of claim objects.

This example doesn't integrate with any specific expense provider; instead the demo focuses on the conversation model in Work Chat.
